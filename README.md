HDRTools package
================
This software package is under development to support 
video standardization work and may eventually be formally 
published as reference software, e.g., by ITU-T and ISO/IEC. 

Please do not use this package for any other applications without 
the knowledge or permission from the software owners/creators.

Disclaimer:
===========
Please note that this software was developed mainly for research purposes, with 
the desire for portability, extensibility, and testing in the context of video
coding standards development. It was highly desirable to make this software 
independent from other "non-standard" libraries, such as libraries for I/O and
processing, to ease compilation and testing across multiple platforms. Instead, 
such functionality may be replicated in this software, while at the same time, 
it may be highly unoptimized or limited in scope. Optimized code, however was
never the intent of this tool. Optimization as well as extensions in scope for
some of this functionality may be added in the future as deemed necessary.
